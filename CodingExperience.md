# My Experience With Coding
> Prior to college, I didn't know much about coding. I knew what is was and what it was used for but I just had no clue on how coding works. It always seemed very intimidating to learn and i thought it was just too hard. I never even wrote my first line of code until I took this class. My first line of code was...

```
print("Hello World")
````

As this class and my other coding class continued I started to pickup and be able to write more and more code. With the help of [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), I was eventually able to write full blocks of code.

Here are some of the code that I have written this semester:
- Paint job Estimator
```
import math

# Get Users inputs

#Get the amount square feet
while (True):
    try:
        square_feet = float(input("What is the amount of square feet of walls: "))
        if (square_feet < 0):
            print("Negative initial positions are not allowed.")
            continue
    except ValueError:
        print("The value you entered is invalid. Only numerical values are valid.")
    else:
        break

#get price per gallon
while (True):
    try:
        gallon_price = int(input("What is the price per gallon of paint: "))
        if (gallon_price < 0):
            print("Negative initial positions are not allowed.")
            continue
    except ValueError:
        print("The value you entered is invalid. Only numerical values are valid.")
    else:
        break

#number of gallons of paint required
amount_of_gallons = float(square_feet * 1 / 350)
amount_of_gallons_rounded = (math.ceil(amount_of_gallons))
print(str("Amount of gallons of paint needed: " + amount_of_gallons_rounded)

#Hours of labor required
labor_hours = float(square_feet * 6/350)
print("Hours of labor required: ", format(amount_of_labor,".1f"))

#Cost of the paint
cost_of_paint = (amount_of_gallons_rounded * gallon_price)
print("Total cost of paint: " + cost_of_paint)

#Calculate labor charges
labor_charge = (amount_of_labor * 62.25)
print("The cost of labor would be: " + labor_charge)

#Calculate total cost
total_cost = (labor_charge + cost_of_paint)
```
- Number Stats

                total += 1

    #Find the Total of the values
                sum_total += total_numbers

    #Find the max and min
                max_value = max(max_value,total_numbers)
