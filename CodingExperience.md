# My Experience With Coding
> Prior to college, I didn't know much about coding. I knew what is was and what it was used for but I just had no clue on how coding works. It always seemed very intimidating to learn and i thought it was just too hard. I never even wrote my first line of code until I took this class. My first line of code was...

```
print("Hello World")
```

> As this class and my other coding class continued I started to pickup and be able to write more and more code.
