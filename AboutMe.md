# A Little Bit About me
> Hello my name is Aaron Guo and I am a freshman at the University of Missouri. **_MIZZOU_** I plan on getting a major in Computer Science and getting a minor in marketing.I came from a really small town called Portageville, Missouri so this transition to college was a major experience for me. In this tiny town my parents owned a local Chinese restaurant called *China King* where I worked as a waiter. I came to college to further my education and hopefully work for a big company as a software engineer.
>>Companies that I would like to work at:
- Google
- Facebook
- Apple
- Microsoft
- Netflix
- Uber
- Airbnb

>I am just a freshman right now and I cannot wait to see where I end up in the future. I plan on securing a job with my degree while working on other side projects and businesses. I plan on getting one of these jobs as a steady source of income and eventually I want to build up more and more sources of income. Whether that is from investing, real estate, or by creating my own company! I am young and I am very excited to see my future! This class has taught me so much and really gave me confidence that I can actually become a software engineer!
