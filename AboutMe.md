# About me
> Hello my name is Aaron Guo and I am a freshman at the University of Missouri. **_MIZZOU_** I plan on getting a major in Computer Science and getting a minor in marketing.
I came from a really small town called Portageville, Missouri so this transition to college was a major experience for me.
In this tiny town my parents owned a local Chinese restaurant called *China King*.
